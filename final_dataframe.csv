I loathe machine politics and got to office defeating an incumbent who got in that way.

However there are quite a few problems with choosing to grind the entire House to a halt to force all 435 members across the country to do a rushed vote on this one individual instance (of many, mind you!).

1. Why is it that this objection wasn’t brought up until now? The author had no problem when Bill Posey did it, or even earlier this year when a member’s account was tweeting post mortem for an election. The standard of this resolution is unevenly applied and choosing to enforce it via privileged resolution for some but not others does open legitimate questions of rationale or motivation. Why not care about this for them, but care about it now? This question has not been answered.

2. This is why the Ethics Committee exists. Establishing this process as precedent will mean all 435 members of the House will be forced to vote on a slew of individual member indiscretions determined by political convenience of whoever is in the majority. I do not think it is the best use of my constituents’ time to sort through the details of every individual matter of a person acting out of accordance with the esteem of the office once a week for a floor vote under rushed circumstances. The House has an investigatory structure for this for a reason. If there was a complaint filed with Ethics or an investigation buried and then ignored, I’d understand. But that’s not the case here.

3. These specific kinds of resolutions can ONLY be executed on a partisan basis because the mechanism of seeking privilege on this can only move forward with GOP leadership’s blessing. That means partisan enforcement and I do not want to open the door to that. Make it nonpartisan or don’t bother - that’s why the Ethics Committee is structured the way it is.

Then he resigned, and is now pretending to be an anti-Communist only for the purposes of splitting Asfura’s vote. The people of Honduras must not be tricked again. The only real friend of Freedom in Honduras is Tito Asfura. Tito and I can work together to fight the Narcocommunists, and bring needed aid to the people of Honduras. I cannot work with Moncada and the Communists, and Nasralla is not a reliable partner for Freedom, and cannot be trusted.

The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels. They and their children are supported through massive payments from Patriotic American Citizens who, because of their beautiful hearts, do not want to openly complain or cause trouble in any way, shape, or form. They put up with what has happened to our Country, but it’s eating them alive to do so! A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family. The real migrant population is much higher. This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.). As an example, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota. Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for “prey” as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone. The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst “Congressman/woman” in our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when her place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military, Police, schools, etc. Even as we have progressed technologically, Immigration Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization. These goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized and illegal Autopen approval process. Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.
